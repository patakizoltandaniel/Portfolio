# About Me
  Currently a Transport Coordinator, I am now situated in a period of professional reconversion into Junior QA Engineer. I am a hard-working person who is attentive to detail, has excellent time-management       skills, very organized and I am looking for a full time position as a Manual Tester. I have knowledge of creating test cases, bug reports, working in Jira, TestRail, Testlink, Qcase, Trello, Postman and also I have experience in following Agile/Scrum methodology when working in a team. I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skills in this fast-paced and dynamic field, so currently I am expanding my skills in automation testing and programming. To work hard for something I think is not just work, I think it is a passion and QA Engineer as well as IT domain in general are a passion for which I am willing to learn everything down to the smallest detail and to be up to date with everything that is new in the field.
